These constraints will be read post-synthesis (as long as their source constraint file is marked as used_in_implementation) and should be applied correctly then. You should review the constraints listed in the file [.Xil/hello_world_propImpl.xdc] and check the run log file to verify that these constraints were correctly applied.
INFO: [Project 1-236] Implementation specific constraints were found while reading constraint file [/home/jj/git_repos/fpau_tests/riscv_cores/riscv-steel-core/hello_world/hello_world_arty_a7_constraints.xdc]. These constraints will be ignored for synthesis but will be used in implementation. Impacted constraints are listed in the file [.Xil/hello_world_propImpl.xdc].
Resolution: To avoid this warning, move constraints listed in [.Xil/hello_world_propImpl.xdc] to another XDC file and exclude this new file from synthesis with the used_in_synthesis property (File Properties dialog in GUI) and re-run elaboration/synthesis.

WARNING: [Synth 8-6841] Block RAM (dual_port_ram_instance/ram_reg) originally specified as a Byte Wide Write Enable RAM cannot take advantage of ByteWide feature and is implemented with single write enable per RAM due to following reason.
(address width (15) is more than optimal threshold of 12. Implementing using BWWE will require more logic and timing would be suboptimal. Please use attribute ram_decomp = power if BWWE is desired.)
